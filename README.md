# Login_and_Form_Repo

## About
This is a project created in django v1.11.  
I made it to test out the concept of a custom user model and social authentication of users with google.  
Django has a default user authentication system with fields like username, first name, last name, email etc.  
I had to add a few more fields to make a Player model for a website that my team and I were developing.

## Sources
Django documentation  
Qrious, a repo forked by me.  

## Concepts
Custom User Model, abstract user model  
Google login (social authentication)
